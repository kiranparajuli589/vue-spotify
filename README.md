## What's Improved From the actual spotify
Open Spotify is a beautiful web apps. Most of the things in the platforms were amazing. But, there are some things that I've improved in this project.

1. If you see the context menu of each card in spotify web, it's fixed on the same position whenever the window is scrolled. But in this project, I've made it to be fixed on the card itself. So, it's more user friendly.
2. The app nav says it's collapsible (tooltip info.), but it's not collapsing. So, I've made it collapsible in this project.
3. The Spotify Web is not mobile responsive. So, I've made it mobile responsive in this project.

## Looking into the code base
- Follows DRY principle
- Proper usage of sass variables
- Proper usage of Vue components
- Proper usage of Pinia store
- Advanced usage of Vue Router
